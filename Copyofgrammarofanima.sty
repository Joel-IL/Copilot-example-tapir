    Puhpowee translates as the force that causes mushrooms to push up from the earth overnight. Biologist Robin Kimmerer was stunned that such a word existed. For all its technical vocabulary, Western science has no such term, no word to hold this mystery. You would think that biologists, of all people, would have words for life. But in Western scientific language, terminology is used to define the boundaries of our knowing. What lies beyond our grasp remains unnamed. A citizen member of the Potawatomi Nation, Kimmerer immersed herself in a Post-it note world of words from this almost-lost language and unexpectedly crossed into an unsuspected grammar of verbs—and a connective new worldview.


    Keywords: interbeing, Potawatomi, language learning, animacy, consciousness

\section 

Ni pi je ezhyayen? asks the little yellow sticky note on my back door. My hands
are full, and the car is running, but I switch my bag to the other hip and pause
long enough to respond. Odanek nde zhya, I am going to town. And so, I do—
to work, to class, to meetings, to the bank, to the grocery store. I talk all day
and sometimes write all evening in the beautiful language I was born to, the
same one used by 70 percent of the world’s people, a tongue viewed as the
most useful, with the richest vocabulary in the modern world. English. When
I get home at night to my quiet house, there is a faithful Post-it note on the clo-
set door. Gisken I gbiskewagen! And so, I take off my coat.

I cook dinner, pulling utensils from cupboards labeled emkwanen, nagen. I
have become a woman who speaks Potawatomi to household objects. When the phone rings I barely glance at the Post-it there as I dopnen the giktogan.
And whether it is a solicitor or a friend, they speak English. Once a week or
so, it is my sister from the West Coast who says Bozho. Moktthewenkwe nda
—as if she needed to identify herself: who else speaks Potawatomi? To call it
speaking is a stretch. Really, all we do is blurt garbled phrases to each other
in a parody of conversation: How are you? I am fine. Go to town. See bird.
Red. Frybread good. We sound like Tonto’s side of the Hollywood dialogue
with the Lone Ranger. “Me try talk good Injun way.” On the rare occasion
when we actually can string together a halfway coherent thought, we freely
insert high school Spanish words to fill in the gaps, making a language we
call Spanawatomi.

Tuesdays and Thursdays at 12:15 Oklahoma time, I join the Potawatomi
lunchtime language class, streaming from tribal headquarters via the Internet.
There are usually about ten of us, from all over the country. Together we
learn to count and to say pass the salt. Someone asks, “How do you say
please pass the salt?” Our teacher, Justin Neely, a young man devoted to lan-
guage revival, explains that while there are several words for thank you, there
is no word for please. Food was meant to be shared, no added politeness
needed; it was simply a cultural given that one was asking respectfully. The
missionaries took this absence as further evidence of crude manners.

Many nights, when I should be grading papers or paying bills, I am at the
computer running through Potawatomi language drills. After months, I have
mastered the kindergarten vocabulary and can confidently match the pictures
of animals to their indigenous names. It reminds me of reading picture books
to my children: “Can you point to the squirrel? Where is the bunny?” All
the while I am telling myself that I really do not have time for this, and what
is more, little need to know the words for bass and fox anyway. As our tribal
diaspora left us scattered to the four winds, who would I talk to?

The simple phrases I am learning are perfect for my dog. Sit! Eat! Come
here! Be quiet! But as she scarcely responds to these commands in English,
I am reluctant to train her to be bilingual. An admiring student once asked
me if I spoke my native language. I was tempted to say, “Oh yes, we speak
Potawatomi at home”—me, the dog, and the Post-It notes. Our teacher tells
us not to be discouraged and thanks us every time a word is spoken; thanks
us for breathing life into the language, even if we only speak a single word.
“But I have no one to talk to,” I complain. “None of us do,” he reassures
me, “but someday we will.”
